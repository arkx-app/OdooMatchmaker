Replit Prompt (Unified Helpdesk + Dashboard + Matching + Messaging)

Build a complete dashboard system with three user types: Client, Partner, and Admin. Include helpdesk, navigation, swiping, matching, and messaging features.

1. Dashboards

Three separate dashboards:

Client Dashboard

Partner Dashboard

Admin Dashboard

Each dashboard should have clear navigation and consistent UX elements.

2. Helpdesk System

Customers and partners can create helpdesk tickets from their dashboards.

Each ticket is saved in the creator’s dashboard and simultaneously in the Admin dashboard.

Admin helpdesk pipeline stages:

Incoming

Assigned

Admin can:

Open tickets

View issues

Change ticket stages

Reply to tickets

Replies from Admin:

Immediately appear in the customer/partner ticket thread

Trigger a notification to the ticket creator

Customer and Partner dashboards do not interact with each other for helpdesk; both only connect to Admin.

3. Navigation

Partner Dashboard:

Every sub-page must have a back arrow at top-left to return to the main dashboard.

Arrow must be consistent in icon, placement, and behavior across all partner sub-pages.

Same principle can be applied to client dashboards where needed.

4. Central Swiping Mechanism (Client + Partner)

Primary feature: Swiping is the first element users see when opening the client or partner dashboard.

Users can:

Swipe through profiles (partners for clients, clients for partners)

Click on a profile to view extra details

Like or dislike profiles

Matching logic:

When both users like each other, it becomes a match.

Matches appear under a dedicated “Matches” tab in both the client and partner dashboards.

Users can scroll through matches and see full details on each match.

5. Messaging System (Client + Partner)

Each dashboard has a Messaging tab:

Shows all matches’ conversations

Allows reopening old messages and starting new chats

Future-proof for adding video call and voice call functionality

Messaging flow:

Once a match occurs, users can immediately start messaging each other

Conversations are saved and accessible from the messaging tab

Notifications are triggered for new messages

6. Dashboard Interconnections

Customer ↔ Admin

Partner ↔ Admin

No direct Customer ↔ Partner connection except via the matching system (likes/matches).

Messaging only occurs after a mutual match.

7. Deliverables

Backend structure to manage tickets, matches, messages, likes/dislikes

UI components for all dashboards

Centralized swiping mechanism

Helpdesk pipeline with notifications

Messaging system ready for future calls

Navigation arrows consistent across partner (and client) dashboards
