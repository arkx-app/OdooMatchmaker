Replit Prompt: Centralized Helpdesk and Dashboard System

Objective:
Create a fully centralized dashboard system with clients, partners, and admin users that includes a single unified helpdesk, swiping/matching, messaging, partner analytics, and user settings. All functionality should be connected across dashboards.

Requirements:

User Dashboards

Create three types of dashboards: Client, Partner, Admin.

Each dashboard must have a settings section where the user can view and update their details (description, goals, industry, etc.) and change their password.

Dashboards must have a back arrow/navigation so users can easily return to the main dashboard from any page.

Centralized Helpdesk

There is only one helpdesk system for all dashboards (no separate “service” or “support” tickets).

Clients and partners can create helpdesk tickets from their dashboards.

All tickets are automatically stored in a centralized database visible in the admin dashboard.

Admins can:

View all tickets from all users.

Change the ticket status (Incoming → Assigned → Resolved).

Reply to tickets.

Replies from admins automatically sync back to the ticket creator’s dashboard.

All dashboards should always show tickets consistently from this single system.

Swiping and Matching (Clients ↔ Partners)

Clients can swipe through partners, see their details, like/dislike them.

Partners can swipe through clients, like/dislike them.

When a mutual like occurs, a match is created.

Matches are recorded in a central database (matches_db) for analytics.

Once matched, clients and partners can start messaging each other.

Messaging

Add a messaging tab in both client and partner dashboards.

Users can reopen messages, send new messages, and continue conversations.

Future-proof the system for video calls or phone calls, even if not implemented yet.

Admins can also message users directly.

Messages sent by partners increment a message counter used for metrics.

Partner Metrics & Admin Analytics

Admin dashboard should display partner performance metrics:

Number of matches

Number of messages sent

Number of tickets created

Activity score (sum of all above)

Display partners ranked by activity score in descending order.

Integration & Real-Time Updates

All features must be interconnected:

Helpdesk tickets sync between user dashboards and admin.

Matches and messages update partner metrics automatically.

There should be no duplicate features. Everything is centralized and consistent.

Priority Features

The swiping mechanism is the most important part of client and partner dashboards and should always be visible first.

User settings should be easy to access from all dashboards.

Navigation should be intuitive and consistent.

Testing / Simulation

Include endpoints or functionality to simulate matches and messages to verify metrics.

Ensure that any ticket, message, or match is reflected correctly in admin analytics.

Instructions for Replit:

Build a centralized backend managing all tickets, matches, messages, and user settings.

Connect client, partner, and admin dashboards to this backend.

Make sure all updates propagate in real time across dashboards.

Make dashboards user-friendly, with navigation and settings accessible.
