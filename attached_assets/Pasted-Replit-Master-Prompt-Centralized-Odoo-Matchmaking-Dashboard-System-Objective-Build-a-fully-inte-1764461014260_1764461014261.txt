Replit Master Prompt: Centralized Odoo Matchmaking & Dashboard System

Objective:
Build a fully integrated platform with clients, partners, and admins, featuring a centralized helpdesk, Tinder-style matchmaking, messaging, analytics, and user settings, with seamless navigation and immediate dashboard access.

Requirements
1. Dashboards & Login

Create three dashboards: Client, Partner, Admin.

Immediately show the dashboard after login; no landing pages, tutorials, or intermediate steps.

All dashboards should have a settings section where users can view/update their details (description, goals, industry, etc.) and change their password.

2. Centralized Helpdesk

There is only one helpdesk system for the entire platform (no separate service/support tickets).

Clients and partners can create tickets from their dashboards.

Tickets are stored in a centralized database visible from all admin accounts.

Admins can:

View all tickets from all users

Update ticket status (Incoming → Assigned → Resolved)

Reply to tickets

Admin replies sync back to the ticket creator’s dashboard.

All dashboards show the same tickets consistently; no duplicate ticketing systems.

3. Swiping / Matchmaking (Tinder-style)

The swiping/matchmaking feature is the first thing users see after login for clients and partners.

Clients see partners with details and can like/dislike them.

Partners see clients with details and can like/dislike them.

Mutual likes result in a match, added to an Active Matches page for both users.

Swiping is centralized, consistent, and records all likes/matches in a central database.

4. Messaging

Both clients and partners have a messaging tab.

Users can reopen messages, start new conversations, and continue chatting.

Admins can also send messages directly to any user.

Future-proof the system for video calls or phone calls.

Partner messages are counted for analytics/metrics.

5. Navigation

All subpages/features within a dashboard must have a back arrow/home button to return to the main dashboard.

Navigation is consistent and intuitive across clients, partners, and admins.

6. Partner Metrics & Admin Analytics

Admin dashboard shows partner performance metrics:

Number of matches

Number of messages sent

Number of tickets created

Activity score (sum of tickets + matches + messages)

Metrics are ranked by activity score in descending order.

7. Integration & Real-Time Updates

All features are interconnected:

Helpdesk tickets sync between user dashboards and admin

Matches update the Active Matches tab in real-time

Messages update counts and partner metrics immediately

Ensure no duplicate features; everything is centralized and consistent.

8. Priority Features

Swiping/matchmaking is the core feature and must be the first thing users see.

Navigation and settings are easy to access from any page.

Helpdesk, matches, and messages are fully centralized and synchronized.
